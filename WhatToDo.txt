	Soft coded, dynamic API;
	Follow Object-Oriented Java Programming Conventions;
	
Todoo:
  Support sprites. //Started on it.
  Use more interfaces. //Started on it.
  Successfully use Reflection with LibGDX.
  LevelRenderer
	  Read pixelmap >
  		Convert the read pixel to the different PixelObjects automaticly depending on their colors. 
  		#Toodoo fully automaticly. Currently Semi Automatic. Needs reflection thus annonations.
  
Problems/Questions:
  Should I store the level of the PixelObjects in it's class or 
  Should I use a static field which gets set to the current Level, Null if not in the real gamescreen.
  

Fixed Problems:	
  Problem = Boundaries for Bounceables are to much to the left:
  	Possible solutions:
	  	Distance check, Get the center of the rectangle, Compare distances of the possible collided block with the center location. 
		  If one of them are nearest then call the collide on that.
	  Possible reasons:
	  	Not breaking out of overlap check loop. 
	  	The boundaries starts from a direction, either left tiles or right tiles maybe messing with the order can fix the problem.
	  	Revert to old and add a break; line.
